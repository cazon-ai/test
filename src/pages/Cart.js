// FIX: ReferenceError: calculateTotal is not defined
// Suggested by Cazon AI at line 89
// Import the calculateTotal function at the top of the file:

import { calculateTotal } from '../utils/calculations';

Or if it's defined elsewhere in the file, ensure it's declared before being used.

// Original code with error
// TODO: Replace with actual file content
